title: "Cloth Segmentation and Background Removal Using U2Net"
excerpt: |
  Fine-tuned U2Net to achieve high-accuracy cloth segmentation for background removal and part identification (top, bottom, and dress). This project focuses on preprocessing clothing images for applications in virtual fitting and fashion visualization.

  ## Project Overview
  Developed a robust solution for cloth segmentation, combining background removal and part segmentation into a single pipeline. The model enables clean and detailed preprocessing for downstream applications in AI-powered fashion and e-commerce.

  ## Objective
  To create a unified segmentation pipeline capable of isolating clothing from backgrounds and categorizing them into parts (top, bottom, dress) with high accuracy.

  ## Process and Workflow

  ### Background Removal
  - Fine-tuned **U2Net** for removing backgrounds from clothing images, creating clean and isolated visuals.
  - Utilized a labeled dataset of clothing images with diverse backgrounds for model training.
  - Achieved high-quality segmentation masks with minimal noise and artifacts.

  ### Background Removal Model:

  ### Cloth Part Segmentation
  - Enhanced U2Net to perform fine-grained segmentation of clothing into three categories:
    - **Top:** Shirts, blouses, jackets.
    - **Bottom:** Pants, skirts, shorts.
    - **Dress:** Full-body dresses.
  - Used labeled datasets with precise annotations to improve model accuracy for edge and texture details.

  ### Cloth Segmentation Output:

  ### Model Optimization
  - Fine-tuned on diverse datasets to handle variations in:
    - Clothing textures (e.g., plain, patterned, transparent).
    - Lighting conditions and shadows.
    - Pose and garment overlap.
  - Validated results on unseen clothing images to ensure generalization across multiple styles.

  ## Deployment and Applications
  - Integrated the segmentation model into an automated pipeline for:
    - Virtual fitting systems.
    - Fashion design and visualization.

  ## Tools and Technologies
  - **Segmentation Model**: U2Net
  - **Programming**: Python
  - **Frameworks**: PyTorch, OpenCV
  - **Applications**: Virtual Fitting, Fashion Visualization
