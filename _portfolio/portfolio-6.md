title: "Virtual Try-on System"
excerpt: " Adapted techniques from the paper ”LADi-VTON: Latent Diffusion Textual-Inversion
Enhanced Virtual Try-On” to develop a robust virtual fitting model. Prepared high-quality training data, implemented
advanced preprocessing (DensePose, Pose Estimation, SCHP), and trained all pipeline modules.
Enhanced garment fitting accuracy by optimizing pose-based alignment and refining model performance,
delivering realistic and scalable virtual try-on solutions.
