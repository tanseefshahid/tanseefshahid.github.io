title: "Virtual Fitting Model for Real-life Clothing"
excerpt: |
  Developed a robust AI-powered virtual fitting system capable of processing real-life clothing images, generating high-quality virtual try-ons, and delivering realistic visuals.

  ## Project Overview
  Designed a virtual fitting system that processes real-life clothing images and generates realistic visualizations of clothing on virtual models, leveraging advanced AI and computer vision techniques.

  ## Objective
  Provide a seamless, scalable, and realistic virtual fitting solution for clients using cutting-edge computer vision and generative AI models.

  ## Process and Workflow

  ### Data Preparation
  - Received real-life clothing images from clients, segmented them manually, and aligned them onto mannequins for realistic wear visualizations.
  - Adjusted clothing images on virtual models using custom coding for natural and precise fitting.

  ### Data Preprocessing for Training
  To train the LADi-VTON framework effectively, several preprocessing steps were performed:

  1. **Pose Model Keypoints**  
     Used a pose detection model to identify 17 keypoints, each representing a specific human body joint:
     - **0:** Nose  
     - **1–4:** Left Eye, Right Eye, Left Ear, Right Ear  
     - **5–6:** Left Shoulder, Right Shoulder  
     - **7–10:** Left Elbow, Right Elbow, Left Wrist, Right Wrist  
     - **11–12:** Left Hip, Right Hip  
     - **13–16:** Left Knee, Right Knee, Left Ankle, Right Ankle  

  2. **DensePose**  
     Leveraged the Detectron DensePose model to generate dense maps and UV mappings for precise clothing alignment on the virtual model.

  3. **SCHP (Self-Correction-Human-Parsing)**  
     Applied SCHP to segment human figures, improving the model’s ability to refine and align clothing on different body parts.

  ### Model Training and Fine-Tuning
  Fine-tuned the **LADi-VTON framework** through multiple steps to improve output quality:
  - **Warp Models**: Improved the alignment between clothing and body pose.  
  - **EMASC and Inpainting**: Enhanced details for realistic visual output.  

  ### Deployment
  - Automated the workflow to process incoming clothing images, run the virtual fitting pipeline, and generate output images.  
  - Delivered final results via AWS S3 for easy client access.  

  ## Key Achievements
  - Achieved high-quality, realistic fits across diverse clothing types and body shapes.  
  - Automated end-to-end data processing and fitting workflows, improving efficiency and scalability.  

  ## Tools and Technologies
  - **Programming Languages**: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV  
  - **Models and Frameworks**: LADi-VTON, DensePose, SCHP  
  - **Deployment**: Docker, AWS S3  
  - **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPUs for training and inference
