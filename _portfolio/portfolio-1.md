title: "Virtual Fitting Model for Real-life Clothing"
excerpt: |
  Developed a robust AI-powered virtual fitting system capable of processing real-life clothing images, generating high-quality virtual try-ons, and delivering realistic visuals.

  ## Project Overview
  Developed a virtual fitting system that processes real-life clothing images and delivers realistic visualizations of the clothing on a virtual model.

  ## Objective
  To provide a seamless, realistic virtual fitting solution for clients using advanced AI and computer vision techniques.

  ## Process and Workflow

  ### Data Preparation
  - Received real-life clothing images and segmented them manually using mannequins.
  - Adjusted and aligned clothing images on virtual models with custom coding to create a natural fit.

  ### Preprocessing
  Prepared datasets by generating:
  - **Skeletons**: Using DensePose for pose extraction.
  - **DenseMap and Keypoints**: For detailed clothing alignment.
  - **SCHP**: To refine segmented regions for accurate training.

  ### Model Training and Fine-Tuning
  - Fine-tuned the **LADi-VTON framework** through multiple stages:
    - **Warp Models**: Enhanced the fit of clothing to the virtual model.
    - **EMASC and Inpainting**: Improved visual quality and realism.

  ### Deployment
  - Automated the workflow to process incoming clothing images and fit them onto virtual models.
  - Delivered the outputs to the client via an AWS S3 bucket.

  ## Key Achievements
  - Achieved high realism in virtual clothing fits.
  - Automated the entire pipeline, enabling scalability for future deployments.

  ## Tools and Technologies
  - **Programming Languages**: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
  - **Models and Frameworks**: LADi-VTON, DensePose, SCHP
  - **Deployment**: Docker, AWS S3
  - **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPUs for training and inference
