title: "Personal Protective Equipment Detection on Construction Site"
excerpt: "Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is key to minimizing injuries from accidents in construction sites. I have developed an AI model build on YOLOv3 to detect PPE components (Hardhat,Vest) from a video stream .It also tracks workers location and notify if someone is in dangerous zone. It was embedded on Nvidia Jetson board for real time object detection on construction site.
