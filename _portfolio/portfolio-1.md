title: "Real-Time Defect Detection System with PLC Integration"
excerpt: |
  Built and deployed a real-time multi-camera defect detection system triggered by external sensors, integrated with industrial PLCs to automatically reject faulty products on a live production line.

  ## Overview

  Developed a fully automated vision system using Basler cameras, Autonics sensors, and a NuDAQ card to detect defective items and trigger air valve-based rejection via PLCs. The system processes each item in under 200ms, handling up to 5 units per second on a live production line.

  ## Workflow

  1. **Sensor Triggering**  
     Autonics sensor detects product arrival and triggers GPIO on each Basler camera.

  2. **Image Capture**  
     On trigger, synchronized frames are captured from multiple Basler cameras covering different product angles.

  3. **Defect Detection**  
     A lightweight object detection model analyzes the captured images in real time to identify surface defects or misalignments.

  4. **Decision & Signaling**  
     Detection results are sent via NuDAQ digital I/O card to the machine's PLC.

  5. **Actuation**  
     If defects are detected, the PLC activates an air valve to physically push the faulty item off the conveyor belt.

  ## Key Features

  - Multi-camera vision pipeline with synchronized acquisition.
  - Sensor-driven image capture for frame-accurate analysis.
  - ~200ms total latency per product; supports 5 products per second.
  - Robust in varying factory lighting and motion conditions.
