I am a Computer vision researcher and Well experienced in writing codes and algorithms as well as building complex neural networks. I worked as a computer vision developer for 2 years in [Ellexi](https://www.ellexi.com/), Seoul. While working as a computer vision developer at Ellexi, I gained substantial experience in computer vision algorithms as well as coding in python and C/C++. At Ellexi, I was primarily responsible for training and developing computer vision applications such as object detection, object classification, Image segmentation, text recognition and object tracking. Additionally, I leveraged my knowledge in computer vision to help developing projects including pose estimation and abnormal action detection.
