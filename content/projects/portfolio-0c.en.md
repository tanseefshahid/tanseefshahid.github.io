  Built a 3D rendering engine with integrated inspection features and a visual node-based workflow editor for designing custom inspection automation pipelines.
---

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive 3D rendering engine tailored for industrial inspection applications. The system features a visual node editor that allows users to design complex inspection workflows by connecting processing nodes, enabling non-programmers to create automated inspection routines.

## Key Features

- **3D Rendering Engine**: High-performance visualization of point clouds, meshes, and CAD models
- **Node-Based Editor**: Visual programming interface for workflow design
- **Inspection Nodes**: Pre-built nodes for common inspection operations
- **Custom Node Creation**: Extensible architecture for specialized operations
- **Workflow Automation**: Execute designed workflows on inspection data automatically

## Node Types

### Input Nodes
- Point Cloud Loader, CAD Importer, Scanner Interface

### Processing Nodes
- Filtering, Alignment, Feature Extraction, Measurement

### Analysis Nodes
- Comparison, Deviation Calculation, Tolerance Checking

### Output Nodes
- Report Generation, Data Export, Visualization

## Technical Architecture

- **Rendering**: Modern GPU-accelerated 3D rendering pipeline
- **Node Graph**: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) execution engine
- **Data Flow**: Efficient streaming of large point cloud datasets
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom nodes

## Tools and Technologies

- **Rendering**: OpenGL/Vulkan, custom shader pipeline
- **Node Editor**: Custom visual programming framework
- **Programming**: C++, Python bindings
- **Data Formats**: Support for common 3D and point cloud formats

## Company

- **Hyvision**, Seoul, South Korea
- **Role**: 3D Metrology & AI Engineer
- **Period**: Aug 2025 – Present
