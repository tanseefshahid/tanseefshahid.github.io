## Overview

Created a professional-grade 3D alignment tool inspired by PolyWorks Inspector. The system provides intuitive alignment workflows for positioning point cloud data within coordinate systems, essential for accurate dimensional inspection and quality control.

## Key Features

- **Best-Fit Alignment**: Automatic registration algorithms for optimal point cloud positioning
- **Manual Alignment**: Interactive tools for precise user-controlled alignment
- **Reference Geometry**: Support for planes, cylinders, spheres, and custom reference features
- **Coordinate Systems**: Multiple coordinate system management and transformation
- **Alignment Verification**: Quality metrics and deviation analysis

## Alignment Methods

1. **3-2-1 Alignment**: Traditional datum-based alignment using primary, secondary, and tertiary references
2. **Best-Fit Alignment**: Iterative closest point (ICP) and variants for optimal registration
3. **RPS Alignment**: Reference point system alignment for consistent positioning
4. **Feature-Based**: Alignment using extracted geometric features

## Tools and Technologies

- **3D Processing**: Custom alignment algorithms
- **Programming**: Python, C++
- **UI Framework**: Modern desktop application framework
- **Visualization**: OpenGL-based 3D rendering

## Company

- **Hyvision**, Seoul, South Korea
- **Role**: 3D Metrology & AI Engineer
- **Period**: Aug 2025 – Present
