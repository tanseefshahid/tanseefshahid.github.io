## Overview

Developed a comprehensive 3D inspection solution that captures module geometry using laser scanning technology. The system processes the resulting point cloud data to perform precise dimensional measurements and identify manufacturing defects.

## Key Features

- **Laser Scanning Integration**: High-precision laser module capture for accurate 3D geometry acquisition
- **Point Cloud Processing**: Advanced algorithms for cleaning, filtering, and analyzing point cloud data
- **Automated Measurements**: Configurable measurement routines for dimensional analysis
- **Defect Detection**: Identification of surface defects, deformations, and manufacturing anomalies
- **Report Generation**: Automated inspection reports with pass/fail criteria

## Technical Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Laser scanner captures module surface geometry
2. **Point Cloud Generation**: Raw scan data converted to dense point cloud
3. **Data Processing**: Noise reduction, outlier removal, and surface reconstruction
4. **Measurement Extraction**: Automated dimensional measurements based on defined criteria
5. **Quality Assessment**: Comparison against tolerances and specifications

## Tools and Technologies
